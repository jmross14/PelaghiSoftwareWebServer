# Akka_HTTP
This is a simple project to demonstrate how to use Akka HTTP and Akka Actors to build a rest api. Keep in mind to check back here for anything that might change in the requirements and also because these instructions will likely grow as as I build out this project.

## Getting Started
Change into the directories for the different projects and follow the instructions in the individual projects' README.md files.
